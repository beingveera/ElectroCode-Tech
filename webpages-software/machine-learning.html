            <h5><u>What Is Machine Learning.?</u></h5>
            <p>Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically
               learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of 
               computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
               </p>


              <p>The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction,
                 in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide.
                  The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust
                   actions accordingly.</p>

            <p> Machine Learning along with the wide range of machine learning techniques such as Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement learning.
               You will learn about regression and classification models, clustering methods, hidden Markov models, and various sequential models.
               Machine learning is a growing technology which enables computers to learn automatically from past data. Machine learning uses 
               various algorithms for building mathematical models and making predictions using historical data or information. Currently, 
               it is being used for various tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, email filtering, Facebook auto-tagging, 
               recommender system, and many more.</p>

            <h5><u>How does Machine Learning work :-</u></h5>
            <p>A Machine Learning system learns from historical data, builds the prediction models, and whenever it receives 
              new data, predicts the output for it. The accuracy of predicted output depends upon the amount of data, as the huge 
              amount of data helps to build a better model which predicts the output more accurately.</p>

            <p>Suppose we have a complex problem, where we need to perform some predictions, so instead of writing a code for it, we just
               need to feed the data to generic algorithms, and with the help of these algorithms, machine builds the logic as per the
                data and predict the output. Machine learning has changed our way of thinking about the problem. The below block diagram 
                explains the working of Machine Learning algorithm</p>

            <p>Machine learning enables a machine to automatically learn from data, improve performance from

                 <li>It is a data-driven technology.</li>
                 <li>Machine learning is much similar to data mining as it also deals with the huge amount of the data.</li>

            <h5><u>Cloud Providers in Market :-</u></h5>
            <p>Businesses can employ cloud computing in different ways. Some users maintain all apps and
               data on the cloud, while others use a hybrid model, keeping certain apps and data on 
               private servers and others on the cloud.<br>When it comes to providing services, the big players
                in the corporate computing sphere include:</p>

               <ol>
                 <li>Google Cloud Platform [GCP]</li>
                 <li>Amazon Web Services [AWS]</li>
                 <li>Microsoft Azure</li>
                 <li>IBM Cloud</li>
                <li>Alibaba Cloud</li>
                 
               </ol>
            <p>Amazon Web Services is 100% public and includes a pay-as-you-go, outsourced model.
              Once youâ€™re on the platform you can sign up for apps and additional services. Microsoft 
              Azure allows clients to keep some data at their own sites. Meanwhile, Alibaba Cloud is a
               subsidiary of the Alibaba Group.</p>

            <h5><u>Advantages of Cloud Computing :-</u></h5>
            <ol>
            <li><p>Cloud-based software offers companies from all sectors a number of benefits, 
              including the ability to use software from any device either via a native app or a
               browser. As a result, users can carry their files and settings over to other 
               devices in a completely seamless manner.</p></li>

            <li><p>Cloud computing is far more than just accessing files on multiple devices. Thanks to cloud 
              computing services, users can check their email on any computer and even store files using 
              services such as Dropbox and Google Drive.Cloud computing services also make it possible
               for users to back up their music, files, and photos, ensuring those files are immediately 
               available in the event of a hard drive crash</p></li>

              <li><p>It also offers big businesses huge cost-saving potential. Before the cloud became a viable alternative,
               companies were required to purchase, construct, and maintain costly information management technology
                and infrastructure. Companies can swap costly server centers and IT departments for fast Internet connections,
                 where employees interact with the cloud online to complete their tasks.</p></li>
            
                <li><p>The cloud structure allows individuals to save storage space on their desktops or laptops. 
              It also lets users upgrade software more quickly because software companies can offer their products
               via the web rather than through more traditional, tangible methods involving discs or flash drives.
                For example, Adobe customers can access applications in its Creative Cloud through an Internet-based
                 subscription.This allows users to download new versions and fixes to their programs easily.</p></li>

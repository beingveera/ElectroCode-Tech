            <h5><u>What is Deep Learning.?</u></h5>
            <p>Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to progressively
               extract higher-level features from the raw input. It’s subset of machine learning where artificial neural 
               networks, algorithms inspired by the human brain, learn from large amounts of data.
               </p>


              <p>Similarly, to how we learn from experience, the deep learning algorithm would perform a task repeatedly,
                 each time tweaking it a little to improve the outcome. We refer to ‘deep learning’ because the neural networks
                  have various (deep) layers that enable learning. Just about any problem that requires “thought” to figure out
                   is a problem deep learning can learn to solve.</p>

            <p>Deep learning allows machines to solve complex problems even when using a data set that is very diverse, 
            unstructured and inter-connected. The more deep-learning algorithms learn, the better they perform.</p>
            <h5><u>How Does Deep Learning Work.?</u></h5>
            <p>Neural networks are layers of nodes, much like the human brain is made up of neurons. Nodes within individual layers are 
              connected to adjacent layers. The network is said to be deeper based on the number of layers it has. A single neuron
               in the human brain receives thousands of signals from other neurons. In an artificial neural network, signals trave
               l between nodes and assign corresponding weights. A heavier weighted node will exert more effect on the next layer of nodes.
                The final layer compiles the weighted inputs to produce an output. Deep learning systems require powerful hardware because
                 they have a large amount of data being processed and involves several complex mathematical calculations. Even with such
                  advanced hardware, however, deep learning training computations can take weeks.</p>
          
          <p>Deep learning systems require large amounts of data to return accurate results; accordingly, information is fed as huge 
            data sets. When processing the data, artificial neural networks are able to classify data with the answers received 
            from a series of binary true or false questions involving highly complex mathematical calculations. For example, a facial 
            recognition program works by learning to detect and recognize edges and lines of faces, then more significant parts of the
             faces, and, finally, the overall representations of faces. Over time, the program trains itself, and the probability of
              correct answers increases. In this case, the facial recognition program will accurately identify faces with time.</p>

            <h5><u>Types of Deep Learning Networks :-</u></h5>
            <p>There are various types of clouds, each of which is different from the other.</p>

            <ol>
              <li><h5><u>Forward Neural Network :-</u></h5>
              <p>A <b>feed-forward neural network</b> is none other than an Artificial Neural Network, which ensures that the nodes do
                 not form a cycle. In this kind of neural network, all the perceptrons are organized within layers, such that the
                input layer takes the input, and the output layer generates the output. Since the hidden layers do not link with
                the outside world, it is named as hidden layers. </p>
                
                <p>Each of the perceptrons contained in one single layer is associated
                  with each node in the subsequent layer. It can be concluded that all of the nodes are fully connected. It does not
                  contain any visible or invisible connection between the nodes in the same layer. There are no back-loops in the 
                  feed-forward network. To minimize the prediction error, the backpropagation algorithm can be used to update 
                  the weight values.</p></li>

                    <p><b>Recurrent neural networks</b> are yet another variation of feed-forward networks. Here each of the neurons
                       present in the hidden layers receives an input with a specific delay in time. The Recurrent neural network
                        mainly accesses the preceding info of existing iterations. For example, to guess the succeeding word in any
                         sentence, one must have knowledge about the words that were previously used. It not only processes the inputs
                          but also shares the length as well as weights crossways time. </p>
                      
                      <p>It does not let the size of the model to increase with the increase in the input size. However, the only problem
                         with this recurrent neural network is that it has slow computational speed as well as it does not contemplate any
                          future input for the current state. It has a problem with reminiscing prior information.</p></li>

                              <li><h5><u>Restricted Boltzmann Machine :-</u></h5>
                                <p><b>Restricted Boltzmann Machine</b>are yet another variant of Boltzmann Machines. Here the neurons present in the input
                                   layer and the hidden layer encompasses symmetric connections amid them. However, there
                                    is no internal association within the respective layer. But in contrast to RBM, Boltzmann machines
                                     do encompass internal connections inside the hidden layer. These restrictions in BMs helps the model

                                      <p>An <b>Autoencoder Neural Network</b> is another kind of unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Here the

                                          is equivalent to the number of output cells. An autoencoder network is trained to display the output
                                           similar to the fed input to force AEs to find common patterns and generalize the data.</p>

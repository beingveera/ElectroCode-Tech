            <h5><u>What Is Cloud Computing?.</u></h5>
            <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources
               include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software.
               </p>


              <p>Rather than keeping files on a proprietary hard drive or local storage device, 
                cloud-based storage makes it possible to save them to a remote database. As long as an electronic
                 device has access to the web, it has access to the data and the software programs to run it.</p>

            <p>Cloud computing is a popular option for people and businesses for a number 
              of reasons including cost savings, increased productivity, speed and efficiency, performance
              , and security.Cloud computing is still a fairly new service but is being used by a number of different 
              organizations from big corporations to small businesses, nonprofits to government agencies, and even 
              individual consumers.</p>

            <h5><u>Types of Cloud Services :-</u></h5>
            <p>Regardless of the kind of service, cloud computing services provide users with a series of
               functions including:</em></p>
               <ol>
                 <li>Email</li>
                 <li>Storage, backup, and data retrieval</li>
                 <li>Creating and testing apps</li>
                 <li>Analyzing data</li>

            <h5><u>Types of Clouds :-</u></h5>
            <p>There are various types of clouds, each of which is different from the other.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
              <p><b>Public clouds</b>provide their services on servers and storage on the Internet. These 
                are operated by third-party companies, who handle and control all the hardware, software, and
                the general infrastructure.Clients access services through accounts that can be accessed by 
                just about anyone.</p></li>
              <li>
              <p><b>Private clouds</b> are reserved for specific clientele, usually one business or organization. 
              The firm's data service center may host the cloud computing service. Many private cloud 
              computing services are provided on a private network.</p></li>
              <li>
              <p><b>Hybrid clouds</b> are, as the name implies, a combination of both public and private 
            services. This type of model allows the user more flexibility and helps optimize the user's 
            infrastructure and security.</p></li>
          </ol>

            <h5><u>Types of Cloud Services :-</u></h5>
            <p>Cloud computing is not a single piece of technology like a microchip or a cellphone. Rather,
               it's a system primarily comprised of three services: software-as-a-service (SaaS), 
               infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), and platform-as-a-service (PaaS).</p>

               <ol>
                 <li><b>Software-as-a-service (SaaS)</b> involves the licensure of a software application to customers. 
                  Licenses are typically provided through a pay-as-you-go model or on-demand. This type of system can be 
                  found in Microsoft Office's 365.</li><br>

                 <li><b>Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)</b> involves a method for delivering everything from operating
                   systems to servers and storage through IP-based connectivity as part of an on-demand service. Clients 
                   can avoid the need to purchase software or servers, and instead procure these resources in an outsourced,
                    on-demand service. Popular examples of the IaaS system include IBM Cloud and Microsoft Azure.</li><br>

                 <li><b>Platform-as-a-service (PaaS)</b> is considered the most complex of the three layers of cloud-based computing.
                   PaaS shares some similarities with SaaS, the primary difference being that instead of delivering software 
                   online, it is actually a platform for creating software that is delivered via the Internet. This model
                    includes platforms like Salesforce.com and Heroku.</b></li><br>

            <h5><u>Cloud Providers in Market :-</u></h5>
            <p>Businesses can employ cloud computing in different ways. Some users maintain all apps and
               data on the cloud, while others use a hybrid model, keeping certain apps and data on 
               private servers and others on the cloud.<br>When it comes to providing services, the big players
                in the corporate computing sphere include:</p>

               <ol>
                 <li>Google Cloud Platform [GCP]</li>
                 <li>Amazon Web Services [AWS]</li>
                 <li>Microsoft Azure</li>
                 <li>IBM Cloud</li>
                <li>Alibaba Cloud</li>
                 
               </ol>
            <p>Amazon Web Services is 100% public and includes a pay-as-you-go, outsourced model.
              Once youâ€™re on the platform you can sign up for apps and additional services. Microsoft 
              Azure allows clients to keep some data at their own sites. Meanwhile, Alibaba Cloud is a
               subsidiary of the Alibaba Group.</p>

            <h5><u>Advantages of Cloud Computing :-</u></h5>
            <ol>
            <li><p>Cloud-based software offers companies from all sectors a number of benefits, 
              including the ability to use software from any device either via a native app or a
               browser. As a result, users can carry their files and settings over to other 
               devices in a completely seamless manner.</p></li>

            <li><p>Cloud computing is far more than just accessing files on multiple devices. Thanks to cloud 
              computing services, users can check their email on any computer and even store files using 
              services such as Dropbox and Google Drive.Cloud computing services also make it possible
               for users to back up their music, files, and photos, ensuring those files are immediately 
               available in the event of a hard drive crash</p></li>

              <li><p>It also offers big businesses huge cost-saving potential. Before the cloud became a viable alternative,
               companies were required to purchase, construct, and maintain costly information management technology
                and infrastructure. Companies can swap costly server centers and IT departments for fast Internet connections,
                 where employees interact with the cloud online to complete their tasks.</p></li>
            
                <li><p>The cloud structure allows individuals to save storage space on their desktops or laptops. 
              It also lets users upgrade software more quickly because software companies can offer their products
               via the web rather than through more traditional, tangible methods involving discs or flash drives.
                For example, Adobe customers can access applications in its Creative Cloud through an Internet-based
                 subscription.This allows users to download new versions and fixes to their programs easily.</p></li>
